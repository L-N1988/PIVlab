%HANINFO Information on Han linear-phase orthogonal wavelets
% The Han real-valued orthogonal wavelets are characterized by a
% specified number of sum and linear-phase moments, 'hanSR.LP' , where SR
% is the order of the sum rules and LP is the order of linear-phase
% moments.
%
% The following combinations are supported:
% 'han2.3', 'han3.3', 'han4.5', and 'han5.5'. 
%
% Family                         Han linear-phase moments
% Short name                     han
% Examples                       'han2.3', 'han5.5'
