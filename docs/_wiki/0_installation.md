# Installation instructions
## Stand-alone application
tbd
## Matlab toolbox
### Requirements
PIVlab needs Matlab and the image processing toolbox to run. It is compatible with releases from Matlab R2019b and later. PIVlab checks for all requirements during startup and will warn you if something misses.
### Setup
My preferred method is to download the zip file from GitHub by going [here](https://github.com/Shrediquette/PIVlab/releases), click 'Source code (zip)' of the latest release and extract the contents to a new folder in your Matlab work directory. Then run PIVlab\_GUI.m.  
Alternatively, download the latest 'PIVlab.mltbx' from [here](https://github.com/Shrediquette/PIVlab/releases), and run it on your computer. It will automatically add the PIVlab toolbox and app in your Matlab installation.
