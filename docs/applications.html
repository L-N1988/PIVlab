<h1>Journal papers etc. that used PIVlab</h1>
<p>I am really happy to see that there is a huge amount of studies that use PIVlab for all kinds of different experiments. Applications include studies of sand and gravel motion, cell motion, blood flow, fluid dynamics (of course... ;-D), flow mapping of rivers, 3D printing, dam breaching and several things that I don't even understand ;-). Most of the citations can be found on Google Scholar:</p>
