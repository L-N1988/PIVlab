<h1>What is PIVlab?</h1>
<p>
    PIVlab is a free graphical user interface (GUI) based particle image velocimetry (PIV) software and is currently
    the most frequently cited PIV software on the market. It can be used to control
    <a href="https://optolution.com/en/products/particle-image-velocimetry-piv/" target="_blank">OPTOLUTION's lasers, cameras and synchronizers</a>,
    and of course it calculates the velocity distribution within imported (or captured) particle image pairs.
    It can also be used to derive, display and export multiple parameters of the flow pattern. The simple GUI makes
    PIV data acquisition and data post-processing fast and efficient.

<h2>You can use PIVlab:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>As a free stand-alone program for Windows computers (all features, no requirements)</li>
    <li>As a free toolbox inside Matlab for every operating system (all features, Matlab required)</li>
    <li>As a free web browser-based app by using Matlab online (no hardware interaction, free Mathworks account required)</li>
</ul>

    <em><strong>Still not sure what exactly PIVlab is, how it looks like, if it is easy enough to use, and if it really is a good choice for doing PIV?</strong></em>
    Then have a look at a quick
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9HDj4oGS98" target="_blank">video demo of how PIVlab looks like</a>
    (very old video, but it shows the principle). Some example results
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXtrEX5X6SI" target="_blank">are presented here</a>.
    Many researchers have published papers (&gt;5000) in high impact journals with the help of PIVlab in the past.
